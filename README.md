# Feed Reader Testing

In this project you I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. In the feedreader.js file can be found my changings.
The code contains four suites in the next topics:
  1. RSS feeds
  2. The menu
  3. Initial Entries
  4. New Feed Selection
This code also contains seven tests, in the order of the given to do list.

# Starting

Just run the index.html file, and you can enjoy this feed reader app.
All test should pass.
